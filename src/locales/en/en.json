        "deliveryText": "In our online store, there is a delivery option without prepayment (cash on delivery) across Russia. Cash on delivery applies to items in stock worth up to 5000 rubles. Payment is made at your post office when you receive the package. Delivery of orders within Russia without prepayment and cash on delivery usually takes 10-14 days. Be careful! When delivering goods with cash on delivery, Russian Post charges an additional 5-7% of the estimated package value for the money transfer service. This fee goes to Russian Post for the 'Cash on Delivery and Money Transfer' service. Therefore, it is often more cost-effective to order goods with prepayment. You can read more about the pros and cons of cash on delivery here. You can receive your order much faster, within 3-7 days across Russia, if you choose EMS mail delivery. EMS mail delivery is also available without prepayment. Delivery is now available to new areas of the DPR and LPR. When placing an order, please specify the full address in the 'Comment' field. Delivery is handled by Russian Post, Class 1."
